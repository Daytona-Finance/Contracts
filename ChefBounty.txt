We have a $1,000 USDC bounty up for grabs for anyone who can get out master chef contract verified.

Our contracts were deployed using remix IDE and a deploy script.
When we tried to verify the contracts after deployment we spend hours trying to get them to take. 
Eventually we were able to get the ERC20 token to take but never the masterchef.

I have now been made aware that you need to verify the contracts using the etherscan pluggin with hardhat.
When I attempted this I am getting a bounce back saying that the contract code doesnâ€™t match the deployed contract.

I have spent days now trying to get the bytecode to match and have come extremely close by bruteforce compiling and creating the artifacts with the various contracts being compiled in different orders.
What I think happend is when the deployment script ran it took an incorrect artifact (possibly from the flat files attached)

I have added 2 folders to the repository one named Verification, this folder contains all the contracts I had in my remix when I deployed.
I also added a DeploymentDataDump folder. When we initially deployed the contracts I downloaded all of the .json artifacts and build info to try to upload to pulse scan. There are 2 dated folders containing .json data I attempted to use to verify.

One last note if you look at the live ERC20 token code which eventually worked on pulse scan verification https://scan.pulsechain.com/address/0x9F8182aD65c53Fd78bd07648a1b3DDcB675c6772/contracts#address-tabs
You can see that it also contains the code for the MasterChef contract this could have some clues in it.
